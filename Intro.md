This course will introduce you to the history of the world’s major
civilizations from medieval times to the early modern era.  You will
learn about the pivotal political, economic, and social changes that
took place in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe during this period.
 The course will be structured chronologically, with each unit focusing
on the expansion or decline of a particular civilization or the
interactions and exchanges between civilizations.  The units will
include representative secondary and primary source documents that
illustrate important overarching political, economic, and social themes,
such as the transformation of western Europe during the Renaissance, the
emergence of a more inclusive world economy, and the impact of early
European exploration and colonization.  By the end of the course, you
will understand how many different civilizations evolved from isolated
societies into expansive, interconnected empires capable of exerting
global influence.
