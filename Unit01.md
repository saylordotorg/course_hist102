**Unit 1: Globalization and History** <span id="1"></span> 
*The resources in this short, introductory section will discuss some of
the meanings and developments associated with the term globalization and
the manner in which they have been used by historians to account for
changes in the lives of peoples throughout the world over time. One of
the major insights to be gained from these resources is that the
cultural and political practices (laws, languages, religions, etc.) of
any given society tend in some measure to reflect the effects of
interactions with the larger world, whether brought about by migration,
trade or conquest.  Students should keep the concepts found here in mind
as they progress through the course.  The following units will in fact
present numerous examples of the diverse forms of encounter and
“interconnectedness” described in the resources below, as well as their
many causes and consequences.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
Time Advisory: Completing this unit should take approximately 1 hour and
30 minutes.

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   identify some of the ideas commonly associated with the concept of
    globalization; and

     Instructions: Watch this short video on Marco Polo, a figure who
    will surface again later in the course. Give particular attention to
    the manner in which Professor Northrup uses Polo’s life and
    experiences to illustrate some of the general concepts and
    implications of globalization. These subjects are addressed again in
    the following two readings.  
      
     Watching this video and taking notes should take approximately 5
    minutes.

    -   Unit 1 provides an overview of the meanings associated with the
        term globalization.  In describing this concept the authors of
        our resources often refer to forms of cultural blending and
        “interconnectedness.”  Using examples found in the resources,
        please identify several of the ways in which this can occur. 
        Again, illustrate your answer with references to specific events
        discussed in the unit assignments and their effects.  
          
         Tips for getting started:  This question asks you to consider
        the different forms of interaction between states and peoples
        that have taken place throughout history.  As indicated in the
        unit assignments, these interactions involve a range of
        encounters and exchanges in the political, social, economic and
        cultural spheres.  It may in fact be helpful to organize your
        answer around these different themes.  For example, what are
        some forms of economic interaction that involve multiple parts
        of the world and what kinds of cultural changes can they bring
        about in the societies involved?
