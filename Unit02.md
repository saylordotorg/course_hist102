**Unit 2: Europe: East and West** <span id="2"></span> 
*In the wake of the collapse of the Roman Empire, two major
civilizations emerged in Europe during the early medieval period.  The
Byzantine Empire, which encompassed territory in the Balkans, the Middle
East, and the eastern Mediterranean, maintained a highly advanced
political, cultural, and economical system between 500 and 1450 C.E.
  Orthodox Christianity defined characteristics of Byzantium and helped
expand the empire’s influence in eastern Europe, Belarus, Ukraine, and
Russia.  Meanwhile, another form of Christianity that had no imperial
center, Catholicism, developed in western and central Europe.  Although
areas of small kingdoms diffused in the early Middle Ages, the fiefdoms
of western Europe had shared some common ground—Latin as lingua franca,
the Catholic Church, and feudal society.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will first study a broad overview of Byzantine
civilization before looking at its more specific components—Orthodox
Christianity, imperial law and government, and Byzantine society.  We
will then turn our attention to an examination of medieval western
Europe, beginning with the historical context of the medieval era and
the definition of the term “Middle Ages.”  We will then study the
emergence of the powerful Carolingian Empire, the expanding scope and
power of the medieval Catholic Church, the significance of feudalism and
manorialism in medieval society, and the devastating impact of the Black
Death.*

     Instructions: This is an ungraded activity. If you choose to
    complete the activity, you may record your answer anywhere you like.
    You do have the option to use the link above to save your answers on

    to do so --  this will only take a minute, and you may do
    so [here](http://eportfolio.saylor.org/users/sign_up).  

    -   The resources in Unit 2 describe the political and cultural
        history of the Byzantine Empire and Western Europe during the
        early middle ages. Although Christianity played an important
        role in both of these worlds, was it practiced in the same way
        and subject to the same authorities?  
          
         Tips for getting started: In this assignment we are using the
        subject of religion as a vehicle for exploring the political and
        cultural boundaries and relations between Byzantium and Western
        Europe. It may in fact be helpful to introduce your response in
        this manner. In preparing your answer, closely review the
        resources for references to the ideas and customs shared by
        Christians of these two worlds as well as the points that
        separated them
