**Unit 4: China's Golden Age** <span id="4"></span> 
*After the fall of the Han dynasty in 589 C.E., China descended into
political and cultural turmoil.  The bureaucracy collapsed and a
“foreign” religion—Buddhism— replaced Confucianism as the primary force
in cultural life.  Decline was evident in most aspects of Chinese
society—including in technology, the economy, and urban areas.  But
beginning in the latter sixth century, two successive dynasties restored
the Chinese bureaucracy and economy.  As we will see in this unit, the
Tang and the Song reinvigorated the Chinese political system and revived
the Confucian order.  In fact, these influential dynasties ushered in
China’s “golden age.”*  
  
 *In this unit, we will begin by examining the downfall of the Sui
dynasty and the subsequent emergence of the Tang and Song dynasties.  We
will then turn our attention to the changes and developments in
government, society, the arts, and the economy during this “golden
age.”*

    -   The Tang and Song eras are often referred to as the “golden age”
        of China. Based on your study of the resources from Unit 4, what
        are some of the developments in politics and culture that might
        be cited by scholars in support of this view?  
          
         Tips for getting started: Please review all the resources from
        the unit closely in order to gain a clear understanding of what
        scholars mean by a “golden age” and the factors that serve to
        distinguish this time period in Chinese history from those which
        came before and after. What are some of the terms that appear to
        surface often in connection with these themes – wealth, power,
        influence, artistic vitality and innovation? Include examples
        from these different spheres of Tang and Song era life to
        illustrate your points.
