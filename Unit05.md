**Unit 5: The Mongol Empire** <span id="5"></span> 
*The Mongols—nomads of central Asia—dominated world history during the
thirteenth century.  The Mongols invaded many postclassical empires and
built an extensive cultural and commercial network.  Led by Chinggis
Khan and his successors, the Mongols brought China, Persia, Tibet, Asia
Minor, and southern Russia under their control.  Often portrayed as
barbarians and destructive warriors, most of the peoples conquered by
the Mongols lived in relative peace, enjoyed religious tolerance, and
had a unified law code.  The Mongol empire also opened trade routes and
communication between different regions in Asia.  As will see in this
unit, the Mongols presented a formidable nomadic challenge to sedentary,
civilized societies throughout Asia.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will begin by examining who the nomadic Mongols were
and what motivated their ambitious expansion.  We will then turn our
attention to specific Mongol rulers, the Mongol military machine, and
the nature of the Mongol imperial system.  We will also examine Mongol
rule in China, called the Yuan Dynasty, and its impact on Chinese
culture.  Finally, we will study outsiders’ perceptions of Mongol rule
and conquest.*

    -   As the resources in Unit 5 indicate, the Mongol Empire extended
        across a considerable part of the world. In this assignment you
        will compare what different historians featured in our resources
        have to say about the nature of Mongol rule. Specifically, do
        you find any major similarities or differences of opinion in
        their assessments of Mongol policies and attitudes towards the
        populations under their control?  
          
         Tips for getting started: This assignment is intended to
        reinforce our understanding of the interpretive nature of
        historical scholarship. That is to say that it is not uncommon
        for historians to arrive at different perspectives or
        conclusions on the causes or nature of the same event. Your
        review of the resources from the unit may suggest several
