**Unit 6: A Changing World Balance** <span id="6"></span> 
*By 1400, a fundamental shift was occurring among the world’s
civilizations.  Chinese and Middle Eastern empires had been at the
forefront of civilization for hundreds of years; sophisticated methods
of governance, trade systems, and technology allowed them to exert
near-global influence.  But Mongol invaders from the East undermined the
preeminent role of the Islamic and Chinese empires.  For a time, the
Ming dynasty of China attempted to fill the power vacuum that appeared
when the Mongols conquered eastern Europe and Asia Minor. * *Meanwhile,
internal and dynastic struggles continued to upset affairs in western
Europe, where some states and kingdoms nevertheless experienced a rise
in political and commercial power.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine world civilizations in a comparative
light to see how and why western European society eclipsed other
powerful civilizations in Asia.  We will first examine the transition
from an Asian-dominated world economy to a European-dominated one.  We
will then consider the two emerging European empires—Spain and
Portugal—who spearheaded trade and conquest in the Middle East, Asia,
Africa, and the New World.  Finally, we will study the Age of Discovery
and its impact on native peoples, Europe, and the balance of world
trade.*

     Instructions: Please read this entire article and consider the
    arguments given by the author concerning the prominence of Asia in
    the world economy during the period 1400-1800 and the manner in

    historians.  The author provides critical reflections here on the
    sources of economic wealth and power in the early modern era and the
    way in which European states and traders ultimately succeeded in
    obtaining a larger measure of both.

     Instructions: This is an ungraded activity. If you choose to
    complete the activity, you may record your answer anywhere you like.
    You do have the option to use the link above to save your answers on

    -   Our knowledge of history is built first and foremost from the
        analysis of primary sources. In the case of Unit 6, what kinds
        of primary sources are used by the authors of our resources to
        create a picture of the Native American peoples and culture?  
          
         Tips for getting started: It is very important that students of
        history know how to distinguish primary sources from secondary
        sources and this assignment will test your ability to do so.
        Remember, primary sources are books, letters, reports, diaries,
        laws, material goods, art, etc. produced during the time period
        that the historian is writing about. In contrast, the book or
        article written by the historian as a result of this research is
        a secondary source. Please read the resources from this section
        carefully and keep a close watch out for the various materials
        from the time period which the historians use to recreate the
        lives and cultures of Native Americans.
