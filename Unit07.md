**Unit 7: Transformation of the West** <span id="7"></span> 
*Beginning in the fifteenth century, western Europe underwent a number
of profound changes.  First, Europe developed many commercial and
manufacturing centers that encouraged contact with other civilizations,
primarily in Asia.  Second, quarrels within the Catholic Church resulted
in a new division among Christians along Catholic or Protestant lines.
 In addition, the rise of rational scientific ideas and new political
philosophies shaped European government and society.  *  
  
 *In this unit, we will begin by studying the advent of the European
Renaissance.  We will define what “Renaissance” actually meant and how
it differed from the medieval period; we will examine influential
Renaissance thinkers and their ideas, as well as the larger impact of
the Renaissance on European civilization as a whole.  We will then turn
our attention to the fundamental changes occurring in the religious
landscape of this era: namely, the Protestant Reformation.  Finally, we
will take a look at the early scientific revolution and new approaches
toward art and architecture.*

     Note on the text: This political treatise was written by Niccolò
    Machiavelli, a Florentine political theorist, in the sixteenth
    century. In an era of constant conflict among Italian city-states,
    Machiavelli asserts that the greatest moral good is a virtuous and
    stable state. Even if actions taken to preserve the state are
    immoral, Machiavelli argues, they remain justified. The text, with
    its “end justifies the means” pragmatism, had a deep impact on
    Western philosophy.

    -   One of our learning outcomes for this course is to be able to
        identify major developments in art and culture that characterize
        the Renaissance and distinguish it from other periods. To
        demonstrate your grasp of this subject please describe and
        compare the works of two Renaissance era artists and indicate
        how their works illuminate some of the predominant themes,
        styles and interests of this era.  
          
         Tips for getting started: The resources in Unit 7 have
        introduced you to a wide range of figures who could be used for
        an analysis of the kind specified above. Note that you might
        consider artists from different genres, including painters,
        sculptors, architects and writers (of course, in some cases, the
        people in question worked in multiple mediums!). Please also
        keep in mind the point made throughout the unit regarding the
        relationship between the artists of the Renaissance and the
        traditions which preceded them. Your ability to speak for
        example about both the continuities and departures between
        Renaissance and medieval culture will add important nuance to
        your answer.
