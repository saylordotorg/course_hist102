**Unit 8: Early Latin and South America** <span id="8"></span> 
*Beginning in the fifteenth century, the empires of Portugal and Spain
founded large colonies in Latin America.  As a result of these
conquests, disease and warfare destroyed or transformed many of the
native peoples who lived there.  Gradually, a new syncretic civilization
emerged in the Americas and became an integral part of the world market.
 Societies comprised of Africans, Spanish, Portuguese, and native
peoples developed a sophisticated market economy driven by gold and
silver mining as well as plantation agriculture.  We will see how the
colonial systems implemented by the Spanish and Portuguese in the New
World had roots in the political and religious institutions of
Europe.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will begin by examining the founding of Spain’s first
New World colony—New Spain—in an area now known as Mexico.  We will
study how the Spanish defeated the Aztec empire and subsequently erected
a colonial government and economy.  We will then turn to Portugal’s main
colonial enterprise in the Americas—Brazil.  We will study Brazil’s
indigenous population and the effects of Portuguese colonization, as
well as the evolution of Brazil’s economy from plantation agriculture to
mining.*

     Note on the text: You may view this text online or on the device of
    your choice, or you may choose to download the PDF version. This
    account, written around 1568, describes the invasion of Mexico by
    Don Hernán Cortés and his 600 Spanish conquistadors in 1519. Despite
    their advanced society, the Aztecs were no match for European
    disease and warfare; three years later, in 1521, the Aztec capital
    surrendered to Cortés. Written from the perspective of the European
    conquerors, this document is one of only a few texts that elucidates
    the collision of Spanish and Aztec cultures in the New World.

    -   As indicated in the unit resources from Unit 8, the Spanish and
        the Portuguese had a long “head start” in the exploration and
        colonization of the Americas, but were ultimately joined by
        other European powers, such as the English, Dutch and French.
        Although there are a number of factors that could be used to
        compare how these different powers operated in the Western
        Hemisphere, please focus on the attitudes and policies which
        each directed toward the indigenous peoples with whom they came
        into contact. What were some of the common features of these
        interactions? Do historians note any special distinctions or
        aspects of these encounters that serve to distinguish, say,
        Spanish relations or attitudes toward the Native Americans from
        those of the English?  
          
         Tips for getting started: Your initial review of the resources
        from this unit should have alerted you to a number of
        similarities and differences in the manner in which the European
        powers came into contact with the native inhabitants of the
        Americas and their subsequent relations. Carefully study and
        analyze these materials again for common forms of interaction
        from one regional setting to the next as well as points of
        difference.
