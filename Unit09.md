**Unit 9: The Muslim Empires** <span id="9"></span> 
*The Mongol invasions of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries broke
apart a unified Muslim world.  But in the wake of these invasions, three
new dynasties rose to power and paved the way for the emergence of an
Islamic renaissance.  The greatest of the three, the Ottoman Empire,
ruled most of Asia Minor.  The Safavids ruled Persia and Afghanistan,
while the Mughals dominated India.  All three empires originated from
Turkic nomadic peoples who embraced Islam and Islamic conversion
efforts. *  
  
 *In this unit, we will begin by studying the Ottomans.  We will
consider their origins, their methods of conquest, as well as the unique
features of their society.  We will also examine the reasons for the
decline and reform of the Ottoman Empire.  Then, we will turn our
attention to the Safavids, studying both their society and
religion—Shi’a Islam.  Finally, we will focus on the Mughals—including
their origins, reasons for their wealth, the formation of their empire,
and outsiders’ cultural and economic interests in the Mughals.*

     Instructions: This is an ungraded activity. If you choose to
    complete the activity, you may record your answer anywhere you like.
    You do have the option to use the link above to save your answers on

    to do so --  this will only take a minute, and you may do

    -   The resources in Unit 9 provide an introduction to the histories
        of the Ottoman, Safavid and Mughal Empires.  In this assignment
        you are to locate additional secondary sources (books or
        articles written by professional historians) that deal with the
        subjects covered in the subunits.  Specifically, you will locate
        one source that addresses a subject found in subunit 9.1
        (Ottoman Empire); another that addresses a subject found in
        subunit 9.2 (Safavid Empire); and a final one that addresses a
        subject found in subunit 9.3 (Mughal Empire).   
          
         Tips for getting started: As anyone who has written a term
        paper knows, it is important to be able to find multiple
        scholarly sources for a particular historical problem or
        question.  Although you are not being asked to write a paper in
        this assignment, you are performing one of the initial tasks
        that goes along with writing a paper – the collection of
        academic works that offer different perspectives on a particular
        subject.   
          
         You might begin by selecting a subject covered by the resources
        in subunit 1, such as the role of Islam in Ottoman government,
        the organization of the empire’s military forces, the policies
        toward minority communities, etc.  The next step is to find one
        other academic source that deals with the selected subject.  In
        order to do this you might visit the website of the American
        Historical Association (AHA).  On this site you will find a link
        to academic journals
        (<http://www.historians.org/pubs/free/journals/>).  Use the
        directory’s list of subjects to locate academic journals that
        deal with our empires.  The AHA site will also provide you with
        links to the journals’ home pages.  When you arrive at the
        journal home page, use the search function to find articles. 
        Note that in most cases you will not be able to access the
        entire article, however, you will be able to read the
        abstracts.  These will should provide you with the information
        necessary to complete this assignment.
