**Unit 10: Africa, Africans, and the Atlantic Slave Trade** <span
id="10"></span> 
*While much of Africa followed its own trajectory of progress in the
post-medieval period, the rise of European trade and influence still had
a profound impact upon African societies.  Perhaps the greatest—and most
horrific—effect upon Africa was the Atlantic slave trade.  The forced
removal of Africans to the New World was first started by the Portuguese
in what is now Sierra Leone in the 1400s.  Soon after, English, Dutch,
Portuguese, and French traders began to enslave and sell Africans to
benefit New World plantation societies.  The result was an incredibly
profitable system of enslavement that transformed European empires,
colonial societies, and the world economy.  
  *  
 *In this unit, we will examine the impact of the many—and
complex—facets of the Atlantic slave trade.  We will examine how the
trade came into being, who was involved, why it was so profitable and so
deadly, how it affected Africa and Africans, and why it ended.*

    -   Unit 10 provides resources that deal with different aspects of
        the African slave trade. In this assignment, you will use these
        resources to describe the experiences of African slaves in
        different parts of the Western Hemisphere. Your answer should
        identify the various destinations of the people taken as slaves
        to the Americas as well as the types of work and conditions they
        were forced to endure on arrival.  
          
         Tips for getting started: In this assignment you are being
        asked to describe the diverse experiences of the people affected
        by the slave trade and the creation of what the resources refer
        to as the “African diaspora” in the Americas. Again, the
        question asks you to consider which parts of the Americas the
        slaves were commonly taken to and why. Did this situation change
        over time? Finally, what types of information do the resources
        provide regarding the type of work (such as the crops produced)
        and other conditions of life the slaves confronted in these
        different regions?
