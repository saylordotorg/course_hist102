**Unit 11: East Asia and Its Trading World** <span id="11"></span> 
*The pre-modern world of South and East Asia was a diverse one linked
together by commerce.  Most politically and culturally independent Asian
states, including India, China, and Japan, were only marginally affected
by the arrival of European traders in the fifteenth century.  Although
the voyages of the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama had opened up the
East to Europe, the power of Asian states and commerce prevented
European nations from dominating lucrative trade networks.  Still, the
strength of European sea power allowed traders to influence many aspects
of the Asian spice trade.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will begin with an examination of the Asian trading
world.  We will ask what this world looked like and why Europeans were
so attracted to it.  In particular, we will study how Portugal, Holland,
and England extended their commercial empires to South and East Asia.
 We will then turn our attention to China and Japan.  We will explore
the unique characteristics of the powerful Ming state in China as well
as the tumultuous era of medieval and pre-modern Japan.*

    -   In this assignment, you will consider Japanese relations with
        the outside world during the Medieval and Early Modern eras.
        Specifically, you will focus on Japanese interactions with China
        and, secondly, its response to the entrance of the European
        maritime powers into East Asia. In doing so, please describe the
        nature of Japanese relations with these different “others.” How
        would you characterize the relations that were established with
        each and what kind of influence did they have on Japanese
        life?  
          
         Tips for getting started: As you will find, the Japanese
        response to these two parts of the outside provides a number of
        interesting scenarios. First of all, what was the nature of the
        relationship between Japan and China? How would you characterize
        the cultural interaction between these two societies? Do you
        find any similarities here to the Japanese response to its early
        encounters with the West? Explain.
